## 🎓 React Concepts Used

This portfolio demonstrates key React concepts:

- **Components** - Modular, reusable UI components

- **Props** - Data passing between components
- **Event Handling** - Form submissions, button clicks
- **Conditional Rendering** - Mobile menu toggle, form submission states
- **Lists & Keys** - Dynamic rendering of skills and projects
- **Controlled Components** - Form input handling

See [REACT_CONCEPTS_GUIDE.md](REACT_CONCEPTS_GUIDE.md) for detailed explanations.
